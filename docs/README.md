# CorMemory Documentation Index

This directory contains versioned documentation for the CorMemory project. Each version is stored in its own directory with the format `vX.Y.Z_YYYY-MM-DD` where:
- X.Y.Z is the semantic version number
- YYYY-MM-DD is the date the documentation was created

## Latest Version
- [v1.0.1 (March 21, 2024)](./v1.0.1_2024-03-21/DOCUMENTATION.md)

## Version History
| Version | Date | Major Changes |

## Versioning Guidelines
1. Major version (X): Breaking changes or complete restructuring
2. Minor version (Y): New features or significant additions

## Documentation Structure
Each version directory contains:
- DOCUMENTATION.md: Main documentation file
- assets/ (if needed): Images, diagrams, or other assets
- examples/ (if needed): Code examples

## Creating New Versions
1. Create a new directory with version and date
2. Copy previous version as starting point
3. Update version and date in the file
4. Make necessary changes
5. Update this index with new version

## Best Practices
- Never modify existing version files
- Always create a new version for significant changes
- Keep old versions for reference
- Update index file with each new version
- Include summary of changes in version history
